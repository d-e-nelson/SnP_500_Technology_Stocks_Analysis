# S&P500_Technology_Stocks_Analysis

## Introduction
In this analysis I will be taking a look at ticker data from stocks in the Information Technology sector of the S&P 500 collected from the start of 2014 to the end of 2017, and all price values in the data set are in USD.

### Columns in Tech_data.csv
1. symbol: This is the ticker symbol for the stock. Ex: AAPL
2. date: The date of the stock's entry.
3. open: The price that the stock opened the day at.
4. high: The highest price the stock recorded for the day.
5. low: The lowest price that stock recorded for the day.
6. close: The price the stock held at the end of the day.
7. volume: The day's trading volume for the stock.
8. Security: The public name of the company that holds the stock. Ex: Apple Inc.
9. GICS.Sector: The wider sector the stock is part of.
10. GICS.Sub.Industry: The sub sector of the sector the stock occupies. Ex: IT Consulting & Other Services

## Data Set Construction
Tech_data.csv is was constructed by combining two seperate data sets and then selecting out a subset of the larger data set that comprised just GICS.Sector data from the Information Technoloy sector. 

**Original Data Set** ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/stock-prices)): Contains stock time series information. The columns it contains include the stock's symbol, date, open, high, low, and close. 

**Added Data Set** ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies?utm_source=chatgpt.com)): This data set contains master data on individual stocks. The data that it provides is the stock's symbol, its security, GICS Sector, and GICS Sub-Industry. 

The two data sets were linked together using the stock symbols as a common field, and then cleaned by having any records with missing data removed.

## Code for creating tech_data.csv

```r
# Navigate to directory where original two data sets are saved
getwd()
setwd('I:\\Data Analytics\\archive')
getwd()

# The original data set
stock_data <- read.csv('stock prices.csv')

# The added data set
industry_data <- read.csv('Industry.csv')

# Combining the data sets on a similar column
stock_data_complete <- stock_data %>%
  left_join(industry_data, by = c("symbol" = "Symbol")) %>%
  drop_na()   # removes any rows where the join didn't find a match

# Removing uncessissary columns
tech_data <- select(tech_data, -Headquarters.Location, -Data.added, -CIK, -Founded)

# Saving the new dataset
write.csv(tech_data, "tech_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```


## My Overall Question
Going into this analysis, the question I want to research is whether there are any variables present in the data set that could be used to predict the future directional change of a stockâ€™s value. This question will be refined and adjusted as I explore the dataset.
